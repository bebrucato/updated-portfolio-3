# Updated Portfolio Pt. III

## Description
This revamped version of my portfolio features an introduction, three of my most accomplished projects, my current resume and my contact information.When the user first lands on my page, they will be greeted with the "Enter" screen, and when the click the link titled "Enter", it will bring them to the homepage of my portfolio. The Home Page has my photo and a brief introduction, and two icons. 

If a user clicks the Project link in the nav-bar, it will take them to my Project Page which features my boozyTunes project, my Virtual Theme Park project and my ReadMe Generator project. Below each project is a button that says "Check it out!" which will deploy the URL of that project in a new window. 

If a user navigates to the Resume Page, they will see a screenshot of my resume and beneath the screenshot is a link that says "Download My Resume Here!," which will then deploy a new window with a downloadable PDF of my resume. Now, last but not least... my Contact Page. This page features my location, links to my GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile. There is also my phone number, and when it is clicked, the user will be asked if they would like to make a call to my number, and my email address, which will open an new email message when clicked.
